    <h1>IIFE</h1>
    <p>
      An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is an idiom in which a
      JavaScript function runs as soon as it is defined. It is also known as a
      self-executing anonymous function.
    </p>



    <script>

        // IIFE 

        (function () {
            console.log("Hello IIFE");
        })()



        // It consist of Two Parenthesis 

        // 1. First Parenthesis means that it is a IIFE Function
        // 2. Second Parenthesis means that it will invoked as soon it is declared.
