    <h1>Callback Hell</h1>

    <p>
      Callback hell is a programming issue that occurs when multiple callbacks
      are nested within a function. This makes the code difficult to read,
      maintain, and debug. It's also known as the "pyramid of doom" because the
      code structure resembles a pyramid.

    <h2>Pyramid of Doom</h2>
    <p>
      In programming, the "pyramid of doom" refers to a code structure with
      excessive nesting of conditional statements or callbacks, making it
      difficult to read, maintain, and debug. It's often seen in languages like
      JavaScript due to its asynchronous nature and handling of callbacks.
